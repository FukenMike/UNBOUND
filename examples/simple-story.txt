PROLOGUE

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young girl who 
dreamed of adventure. Her name was Emma, and she had never left her 
small village.

But dreams have a way of becoming reality when you least expect it.

CHAPTER ONE

Emma woke to the sound of horses galloping through the village square.
She rushed to her window and saw soldiers in crimson uniforms, their
armor gleaming in the early morning light.

Something was wrong.

By noon, the entire village had gathered in the square. The captain 
of the guard stood on a wooden platform, his face grave.

"The dragon has returned," he announced. "We need volunteers."

Emma's heart raced. This was it. This was her chance.

CHAPTER TWO

The journey to the dragon's lair took three days. Emma traveled with 
a group of five other volunteers, none of whom she had known before.

They were an unlikely band: a former merchant, a blacksmith's 
apprentice, a wandering minstrel, a retired soldier, and a scholar 
from the capital.

And Emma, the farm girl who dreamed of more.

On the third night, they camped at the base of the mountain. The 
dragon's lair was somewhere above, hidden in the clouds.

"Why did you volunteer?" the scholar asked Emma as they sat by the fire.

She thought for a moment. "Because I had to know if I was brave enough."

He nodded slowly. "That's the best reason I've heard yet."
